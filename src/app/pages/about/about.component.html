        I'm a software engineer living in West Chester, OH with my amazing wife, Sarah. I enjoy
        developing apps as well as playing games and music. I grew up in Loveland, OH and graduated
        from the University of Cincinnati in 2018. While in college, I worked for the Air Force
        Research Lab, several startups, and as a Teaching Assistant.

        Since graduation, I've worked for both GE Digital and Kroger. My better half currently works
        as a software engineer for GE Aerospace, and we nerd out about technology on a regular
        basis. Besides work, we like to travel, cook new food, and spend time with our friends and
        family.

        Sarah and I met during our sophomore year of college in 2016 and have been best friends ever
        since. She attended the University of Kentucky and moved to Cincinnati after graduation. We
        were married in 2020, purchased our first home in 2021, and are currently enjoying our
        <i>simple</i> work/life balance.
